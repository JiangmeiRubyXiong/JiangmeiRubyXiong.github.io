## Bio

Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/biostatistics-graduate/). I am primarily working with single-cell imaging data, and in particular with colorectal-cancer-related data. I occasionally dab in public health related social media data as well. I find great motivation in developing statistical method that aids the research in basic sciences, and I also love reading about statistical thinking from different perspectives. 

## Education

 - Ph.D. in Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University | Nashville, TN
 - M.A. in Statistics, Columbia University | New York, NY
 - Bachelor of Actuarial Studies, Aunstralian National University | Canberra, ACT, Australia
