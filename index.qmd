## Bio

Welcome! I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/biostatistics-graduate/). My main research interests are in:

- Statistical methods in medical imaging
- Health informatics
- Cancer research

See more work details at the research tab!

I am also the President of the Vanderbilt Biostatistics Grad Student Organization (recognized by the ASA) on campus and the Council for Emerging and New Statisticians [(CENS) with ENAR](https://www.enar.org/meetings/spring2025/profdev/cens.cfm). Besides that, I have been singing in the [Vanderbilt Community Chorus](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/community-chorus/) for 3 years, performing various music styles from Broadway to Bach.

I anticipate graduating in Spring 2025 and am actively considering post-docs related to biomedical data science research. Feel free to reach out and connect with me via email!
