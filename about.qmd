# Semi-automated marker gating of Multiplexed Immunofluorescent Images (mIF)

This type of novel medial imaging data is what my PhD dissertation research is mainly about. My [orals exam documentation](https://jiangmeirubyxiong.github.io/OralsExam/) gives a brief overview on what it is.

We published a paper in Bioinformatics describing the R package we developed for marker gating in mIF. This paper is [featured in NCI](https://datascience.cancer.gov/news-events/news/gammagater-helps-decipher-imaging-data).
